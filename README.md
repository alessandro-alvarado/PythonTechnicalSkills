<h1>Python Technical Skills</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
As part of my coursework in CISA 3335 – Data Analysis Using Python, I completed a series of hands-on projects designed to develop and showcase core data analysis skills using real-world datasets. Each assignment focused on a specific set of tools and techniques—from data wrangling and exploratory visualization to time series analysis and financial data interpretation. Below is a breakdown of the key technical skills I demonstrated across these projects, along with references to the specific files where each skill was applied.

<h2>Core Skills</h2>

<b>1.  Data Wrangling & Cleaning</b>
- Imported and parsed structured .csv datasets using pandas.read_csv().

  <b>Seen in:</b> Reading_and_Subsetting_Data, Plotting , Working_with_Dates

- Filtered and subsetted data using conditional logic and column selection (e.g., ZIP codes, AGI levels).

  <b>Seen in:</b> Reading_and_Subsetting_Data

- Created new DataFrames to isolate variables of interest.

<b>2. Aggregation & Statistical Analysis</b>
- Summarized data using .sum(), .mean(), .std(), and grouped calculations.

- Analyzed financial and demographic datasets to extract meaningful patterns.

<b>3. Data Visualization</b>
- Built visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including bar plots, box plots, histograms, and scatter plots.

  <b>Seen in:</b> Plotting 

- Applied styling, titles, and labels to improve visual clarity and presentation.

  <b>Seen in:</b> Plotting 

- Used count plots and comparative visualizations to explore customer trends and product data.

<b>4.  Time Series Analysis</b>
- Parsed date data and set time-based indices with parse_dates=True and index_col.

  <b>Seen in:</b> Working_with_Dates 

- Conducted monthly and yearly trend analysis using .resample() and .loc[].

  <b>Seen in:</b> Working_with_Dates 

- Aggregated stock price data (e.g., IBM) to evaluate financial performance over time.
